This directory includes files that can be compiled using GNU binutils
into a(n almost) valid GBA cartridge.
The only thing not done right now is applying the ~gbafix~ tool to the
ROM so that it would be accepted by a real Nintendo console.
Emulators do not care about this restriction and therefore I decided
to skip if for now.

* TODO Play with crt0.s and the linker script

Right now the linker script is drastically overcomplicated and
includes many things related to C.
The same applies for the ~crt0.s~.
Many of the things it does are not needed for this plain example.
A useful task for getting a feeling for the build process would be to
minimize the linker script and ~crt0.s~ so that it does just what's
necessary.
