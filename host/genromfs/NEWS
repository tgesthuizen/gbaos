Changes since 0.5.7:

* Make extension options really able to copy the current data.
* Detect unparseable numbers in the extended options.
* Tags were stored in an incorrect order, making any value of uids, gids and
  timestamps larger than 4095 ending up with a wrong value.

Changes in the not released 0.5.7:

* A test suite is now included (but may not work correctly in all
  circumstances).
* Implemented including files by pattern, and combining this with excludes
* It is now possible to override alignment with a smaller value:
  genromfs -A2048,*.boot -A1024,m68k.boot -A512,m68k.boot
* Unix permissions, including mode bits, user and group id, and even
  mtime may be saved for individual files.  This needs a format change,
  which is backward compatible, but older kernels will not recognise
  any of these features.

Changes in release 0.5.2:

* faked device names may contain the special characters "-" "_" and "+"
  Thanks to Greg Ungerer
* code changes -- avoid possible side effects of ntohl(), and report
  nonexistant directories instead of a segfault
  Thanks to Ilguiz Latypov
* version numbers are checked at make distcheck time
